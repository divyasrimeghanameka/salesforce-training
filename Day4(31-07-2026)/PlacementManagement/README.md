# Salesforce DX Project

Salesforce DX is a development approach that brings source-driven development, team collaboration, and continuous integration to the Salesforce Platform. Instead of working directly in an org through a web browser, you work with metadata as source files in a local DX project, track changes in version control, and deploy through automated processes.

This project template gets you started with the tools and structure you need to build Salesforce applications using source control, scratch orgs, and the Salesforce CLI.


## Project Structure

Your DX project follows this structure:

- **`force-app/main/default/`** - Your metadata source files live in this default package directory. You can configure additional package directories in the `sfdx-project.json` file.
- **`sfdx-project.json`** - Project manifest that defines package directories, namespace, API version, and other project-level settings
  

## Common Salesforce CLI Commands

Here are common CLI commands that you'll use the most:

- `sf org login web`: Authorize an org
- `sf org open`: Open your org in a browser
- `sf org create scratch`: Create a scratch org
- `sf project deploy start`: Deploy metadata to your org
- `sf project retrieve start`: Retrieve metadata from your org
- `sf template generate <artifact>`: Scaffold new components, such as Apex classes and triggers, LWC components, Lightning apps, and more
- `sf config <command>`: Configure CLI settings
